Description: The  four layer reductive lithograph translates drawings made during a performance of 'More Blacks, More Dogs, More Irish' by Soreslap Theatre Company at Alphabet Theatre (2022). The print captures the figures of the two actors through gestural bodily mark making and the transformation of the space between them into a bird like creature that is the physical embodiment of their connection.
