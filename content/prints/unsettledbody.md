Description: 'The Unsettled Body, An Embodied Gaze' embodies movement, it presents a continuous, writhing mass of bodies, where the movement of dancers are translated into gesture and line. The work is informed by a methodology of researching movement through an embodied practice of drawing, in collaboration with dance groups, theatre companies and schools. Embodied knowledge is understood through Shigenori Nagatomo’s definition of a knowledge that resides not only in the body, but that is gained through the body. 

Inspired by dancers at The Rambert, I created automatic drawings that explore the connection between eye, hand and mark. As the temporal, movement, is moved to the material, mark, there is transformation from passive observer to active participant. Drawing movement expresses an internal state of being emotionally moved and becomes an intimate way of understanding the relationship between the performer and viewer, through the artist’s body. 'The Unsettled Body, An Embodied Gaze' is a 're-performance' of these automatic drawings. The marks of movement are translated and redrawn on a lithographic stone, that acts as a holder of the temporal, before being impressed into paper. These lithographs explores dynamics of movement and trace through the symbol of the unsettled body.  #Ca[tion for main image and description for alt images
