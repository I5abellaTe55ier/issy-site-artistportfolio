‘Poetics of The Unsettled Body’ was exhibited in The Royal College of Art's Graduate showcase in 2024. It presents the space between performance, the material mark and the dematerialised interface as permeable, bringing together a technological gaze of the moving body, explored through motion capture and 3D editing software, with a methodology of automatic drawing and traditional print processes that translate movement through an embodied, internal gaze. The installation consists of a video work, a lithograph diptych, a takeaway text and a charcoal wall drawing that are all translations of the body moving in time and space.

The video work, ‘The Technological Gaze’, explores the interconnection between gestures of making, seeing and moving, through the interface of the body. Working in collaboration with the dancer, Eloise Frey, the artwork uses motion capture to record both the dancer’s movement and the actions of the artist responding to the dancer through drawing. Motion capture relies on many digital eyes that capture movement ’in the round’. Using Cinema 4D, this data has been manipulated to transform the bodies of the dancer and artist into lines and trace. The installation compares the human eye and mark to the digital eye and mark to question if a technological gaze can capture the embodied interactions between performer and artist?
