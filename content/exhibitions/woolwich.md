Woolwich Contemporary Print Fair is the largest international art platform celebrating contemporary print. Chosen for the curated hang as a collectors pick, 'Karina and Me' explores the relationship between myself and the image of a dancer from a 1898 film reel, Karina. After a year long pseudo collaboration with Karina, imagining her as an image beyond the glimpse of her filmed self, this print explores the intermingling of our identity. By mixing the icons of Karina's iconic dress with my self portrait, I picture us as intertwined figures reaching out to each other.  
Â£160  
Karina and Me is avaiable for purchase upon contact.
